# OpenAi---Frozen-Lake-Problem
The frozen Lake Probelm
The Frozen Lake environment is a 4×4 grid which contains four possible areas  — Safe (S), Frozen (F), Hole (H) and Goal (G). 
The agent moves around the grid until it reaches the goal or the hole. 
The agent has 4 possible moves which are represented in the environment as 0, 1, 2, 3 for left, right, down, up respectively.
If it falls into the hole, the agent gets 0 reward and has to start from the beginning and is rewarded the value 0. 
The process continues until it learns from every mistake and reaches the goal eventually. 

This is a great introduction to Q-table and using Reinforcement Learning.
